# Revit24 Data Studio — Architecture

Internal administration platform for discovering, collecting, organizing, classifying, reviewing, approving, and importing publicly available automotive community data into ShiftIt.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15+** App Router
- **TypeScript** (strict)
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui**
- **Firebase Authentication** (architecture prepared)
- **Firestore** (import jobs & records persisted)
- **Vercel** deployment target

## Data Flow (Import Center)

```
UI Component
    ↓
API Route / Server Component
    ↓
Service Layer (importJobService)
    ↓
Repository Layer (importJobsRepository, importRecordsRepository)
    ↓
Firestore (import_jobs, import_records)
```

Validation (`lib/validation/instagramProfileInput.ts`) remains pure — no network calls.

## Phase 4 — Firestore Persistence

- Instagram bulk import jobs persisted to `import_jobs`
- Normalized profile records persisted to `import_records`
- Duplicate detection queries existing records by username
- Dashboard statistics loaded from Firestore when configured
- Application events logged to `logs` collection
- Mock Mode fallback when Firebase env vars are missing

## Phase 5 — Admin Review Center

Every imported record must pass individual admin review before ShiftIt can consume it. Nothing becomes live automatically.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/review` | Review dashboard with summary cards, queue table, activity panel |
| `/review/[recordId]` | Record detail with moderation actions |
| `/review/duplicates` | Duplicate resolution center |
| `/review/approved` | Searchable approved records list |
| `/review/rejected` | Rejected records (reopenable) |

### Data Flow (Review Center)

```
Review UI (components/review/)
    ↓
API Route (app/api/review/[recordId])
    ↓
Service Layer (reviewService)
    ↓
Repositories (importRecords, approvedRecords, reviewHistory, appLogs)
    ↓
Firestore (import_records, approved_records, review_history, logs)
```

### Approval Lifecycle

1. Import creates `import_records` with `reviewStatus: pending_review` (valid rows)
2. Reviewer opens record in Review Center
3. Action (approve / reject / needs_edit / duplicate / merge_later) updates `import_records.reviewStatus`
4. Every action creates a `review_history` entry and logs to `logs`
5. On **approve**, a snapshot is copied to `approved_records` — original `import_record` is retained
6. ShiftIt will consume only `approved_records` (future phase)

### Review Record Statuses

`pending_review` · `approved` · `rejected` · `duplicate` · `needs_edit` · `merged`

Validation status (`valid` / `duplicate` / `invalid`) remains separate from review status.

### Role Permissions (Architecture Only)

| Role | Approve | Reject | Edit | Merge | Read-only |
|------|---------|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| Admin | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Reviewer | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| Collector | | | | | ✓ |

Auth enforcement is deferred — `getDefaultReviewPermissions()` returns admin permissions for now.

## Phase 6 — Extraction Queue & Worker Management

Infrastructure for future extraction workers — think **GitHub Actions for data collection**. No extraction, scraping, or worker execution in this phase.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/queue` | Queue dashboard with summary cards and job table |
| `/queue/[jobId]` | Job detail — progress, timeline, extraction records |
| `/queue/history` | Completed, failed, and cancelled jobs |
| `/workers` | Worker fleet overview (mock data) |
| `/workers/logs` | Searchable worker event logs |

### Data Flow (Extraction Queue)

```
Queue UI (components/queue/)
    ↓
API Route (app/api/queue/[jobId])
    ↓
Service Layer (queueService, workerService)
    ↓
Repositories (extractionJobs, extractionRecords, workerLogs)
    ↓
Firestore (extraction_jobs, extraction_records, worker_logs)
```

### Extraction Job Lifecycle (Architecture)

1. Approved import job generates an **Extraction Job** via `createExtractionJobFromImportJob()`
2. Valid import records become **Extraction Records** (waiting status)
3. Future workers poll the queue, claim jobs, and update progress
4. UI actions (queue, pause, resume, cancel, retry, priority) update status only — no execution
5. Worker logs stream to `worker_logs` collection (future)

### Job Status Values

`waiting` · `queued` · `running` · `paused` · `completed` · `failed` · `cancelled` · `retrying`

### Priority Levels

`low` · `normal` · `high` · `critical`

### Future Worker Lifecycle

```
Worker registers → sends heartbeat → polls for queued jobs
    → claims job → processes extraction records → updates progress
    → writes worker_logs → marks job completed/failed
```

Planned worker targets: Mac Studio, MacBook Pro, Ubuntu VPS, Windows Desktop.

### Progress Model

```typescript
progressPercent = Math.round((processedRecords / estimatedRecords) * 100)
```

Displayed via animated progress bars in queue table and detail views.

## Phase 7 — Instagram Public Profile Extraction Worker (MVP)

First extraction worker — processes **one public Instagram profile at a time** with manual and small-batch execution. Uses a generic `ProfileExtractionProvider` interface so Instagram, Google Places, TikTok, or other providers can be swapped without changing queue UI or services.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/profiles/[username]` | Internal extraction quality review (not ShiftIt) |
| `POST /api/extraction/instagram` | Manual single profile or small batch test |
| `POST /api/queue/[jobId]/extract` | Run extraction worker against queue job records |

### Worker Architecture

```
workers/instagram/
  instagramProfileExtractor.ts   → ProfileExtractionProvider (fetch public HTML)
  instagramProfileParser.ts      → Parse og:meta + public JSON only
  instagramProfileWorker.ts        → Process one extraction record
  instagramWorkerRunner.ts         → Sequential batch runner
```

```
instagramExtractionService
    ↓
ProfileExtractionProvider (interface)
    ↓
InstagramProfileExtractor (default) — swappable with Playwright / Graph API later
    ↓
instagramProfilesRepository → instagram_profiles collection
```

### Extraction Lifecycle

1. Extraction job contains records with public profile URLs
2. Worker fetches public HTML (or mock mode via `INSTAGRAM_EXTRACTION_MODE=mock`)
3. Parser extracts only publicly visible metadata (og:tags, public counts, bio text)
4. Public email/phone extracted **only from bio text** if visibly written
5. Results saved to `instagram_profiles` — separate from approved ShiftIt records
6. Extraction record + job progress updated; events logged to `worker_logs`

### Public Metadata Collected

Username, display name, bio, profile URL, profile image, website, follower/following/post counts (if visible), verified badge, business category, public email/phone from bio only.

### Error Handling

`PROFILE_NOT_FOUND` · `PRIVATE_PROFILE` · `NETWORK_FAILURE` · `TIMEOUT` · `UNEXPECTED_HTML` · `PARSE_ERROR` — with retryable vs non-retryable classification.

## Phase 8 — Data Normalization & Enrichment Engine

Transforms raw extracted public metadata into structured automotive entities ready for admin review. **Deterministic rules only** — no AI, LLM, or automatic approvals in this phase.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/entities` | Normalized entity list with summary cards and search |
| `/entities/[id]` | Entity preview — profile, brands, tags, matches, review status |
| `POST /api/normalization/run` | Trigger normalization for completed Instagram profiles |

### Data Flow (Normalization Pipeline)

```
Raw Extracted Metadata (instagram_profiles, future providers)
    ↓
normalizationPipeline.runNormalizationPipeline()
    ↓
Services: normalizationService · tagService · entityTypeService
          brandDetectionService · locationNormalizationService · confidenceService
    ↓
Repositories (normalizedRecords, entityMatches, normalizationLogs)
    ↓
Firestore (normalized_records, entity_matches, normalization_logs)
    ↓
Status: pending_review
```

### Normalized Record Model

Key fields: `source`, `sourceRecordId`, `entityType`, `displayName`, `username`, location fields, `tags`, `vehicleBrands`, `specialties`, `socialLinks`, `confidenceScore`, `status`, `workerVersion`.

Supported entity types: Club, Member, Shop, Detailer, Wrap Shop, Tint Shop, Wheel Shop, Performance Shop, Dyno Shop, Photographer, Videographer, Content Creator, Dealer, Track, Event Organizer, Car Event, Community Zone, Unknown.

### Confidence Scoring

Mock rule-based scoring (25–95) via `confidenceService.ts`:

- Base score 25, additive points for display name, username, bio, website, email, phone, location, brands, tags, known entity type, verified badge
- Labels: High (≥85), Medium (≥60), Low (≥40), Very Low (<40)

### Entity Matching (Duplicate Detection)

`entityMatchingService.ts` compares username, website, phone, public email, display name, city, and country across normalized records.

Output levels: **High Confidence**, **Medium**, **Low**, **Possible Match**, **No Match**.

**Detect only — no merge** performed. Matches stored in `entity_matches`.

### Tag Engine

Deterministic keyword matching in `tagService.ts` and `brandDetectionService.ts` for automotive brands (BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, etc.) and specialty tags (Drift, Track, Detailing, Wrap, etc.).

### Future AI Integration Points

| Service | Current | Future AI Replacement |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| `entityTypeService` | Keyword rules | LLM classification with confidence |
| `tagService` | Keyword dictionary | Semantic tag extraction |
| `brandDetectionService` | Brand name matching | NER / brand ontology |
| `locationNormalizationService` | Bio text parsing | Geocoding + address parsing |
| `confidenceService` | Additive mock rules | ML confidence model |
| `entityMatchingService` | Field equality + fuzzy name | Embedding similarity |

All services accept structured inputs and return typed outputs — swap implementations without changing pipeline orchestration.

### Dashboard Integration

Main dashboard displays pipeline stats: Raw Imports, Extraction Jobs, Normalized Records, Pending Review, Approved.

## Phase 9 — Worker Runtime & Job Processing Engine

First phase with **real processing**. The worker runtime polls Firestore, claims queued extraction jobs atomically, processes records sequentially, updates progress, logs events, and triggers normalization after successful extraction.

### Routes & API

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/workers` | Live worker fleet — heartbeats, current job, CPU/memory placeholders |
| `GET /api/workers` | List registered workers with live/offline status |
| `POST /api/workers/runtime/tick` | Run one poll → claim → execute cycle |
| `GET /api/queue/live` | Live queue progress for auto-refresh (10s polling) |

### Worker Runtime Architecture

```
workers/runtime/
  workerRuntime.ts          → Main loop (register → heartbeat → poll → execute)
  jobScheduler.ts           → Find claimable jobs by priority
  jobExecutor.ts            → Platform-agnostic job execution
  heartbeat.ts              → 30s heartbeat interval
  workerRegistration.ts     → Worker identity + platform detection
  shutdownHandler.ts        → Graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown
  extractionProviderRegistry.ts → Platform → provider mapping
  providers/instagramExtractionProvider.ts → Instagram implementation
```

```
Worker starts
  → registerWorkerInstance() → workers collection
  → heartbeat every 30s → lastHeartbeat, status, currentJob
  → claimNextQueuedJob() → Firestore transaction (queued/retrying → running)
  → executeExtractionJob() → ExtractionProvider (NOT Instagram-specific)
  → per record: extract → save profile → normalize → update progress → log
  → mark job completed → poll again
```

Run as standalone process: `npm run worker`

Configuration: `lib/config/runtime.ts` (polling interval, heartbeat, retry count, batch size, worker name/version).

### Worker Registration (`workers` collection)

Fields: `id`, `hostname`, `machineName`, `platform`, `version`, `status`, `startedAt`, `lastHeartbeat`, `currentJob`, `jobsCompleted`, `cpuUsagePercent`, `memoryUsagePercent`.

Workers considered offline when heartbeat expires (default 90s).

### Job Claim Flow

1. Worker polls for jobs with status `queued` or `retrying`
2. Jobs sorted by priority (critical → high → normal → low)
3. Firestore transaction atomically sets `status: running`, `claimedByWorkerId`, `claimedAt`
4. If another worker already claimed → transaction fails → skip
5. Only ONE worker processes a job at a time

### Processing Flow (per record)

```
Load next pending extraction_record
  → ExtractionProvider.executeJob() (Instagram provider for now)
  → Save to instagram_profiles
  → normalizeInstagramProfile() → normalized_records
  → Update job progress (processed, successful, failed, %)
  → Write worker_logs event
```

### Retry Logic

- Max attempts: configurable (default 3)
- Retry delay: configurable (default 5s)
- Retryable errors: `NETWORK_FAILURE`, `TIMEOUT`, `RATE_LIMITED`
- Permanent errors: `PROFILE_NOT_FOUND`, `PRIVATE_PROFILE`, `PARSE_ERROR`
- Record status: `retrying` between attempts

### ExtractionProvider Interface

Runtime never depends on Instagram directly. Platform providers implement `ExtractionProvider` in `lib/types/extraction-provider.ts`. Registry at `workers/runtime/extractionProviderRegistry.ts` — future: Google Places, TikTok, YouTube, Website.

## Phase 10 — Google Places Business Discovery & Import

Collectors discover automotive businesses via Google Places (or mock data when API key is not configured). Results flow into the existing review and normalization pipeline — no separate business model.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/google-places` | Discovery hub overview |
| `/google-places/search` | Search filters — country, city, keyword, category, radius |
| `/google-places/results` | Search results table/cards with bulk actions |
| `/google-places/jobs` | Search job history |
| `/google-places/[placeId]` | Business detail with map placeholder + duplicate detection |
| `/imports/google-places` | Import Center entry (redirects to search) |

### Business Discovery Flow

```
Collector configures search (SearchFilters)
  → POST /api/google-places/search
  → placesSearchService.runPlacesSearch()
  → BusinessDiscoveryProvider.search() (GooglePlacesDiscoveryProvider)
  → places_search_jobs + google_places_raw
  → Results UI with bulk actions
  → POST /api/google-places/import
  → placesImportService → import_jobs + import_records (review workflow)
  → placesNormalizationService → normalized_records (existing pipeline)
```

### Provider Interface

`BusinessDiscoveryProvider` in `lib/types/business-discovery.ts` — UI and services depend on the interface, not Google directly. Future providers: OpenStreetMap, Apple Maps, TomTom, Custom Import.

Implementation: `GooglePlacesDiscoveryProvider` in `googlePlacesService.ts`. Uses live Google Places Text Search API when `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is set; otherwise generates realistic mock automotive businesses.

### Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `saved_searches` | Named search templates for collectors |
| `places_search_jobs` | Search execution jobs with status and counts |
| `google_places_raw` | Raw discovered business records |

### Normalization Flow

`googlePlaceToRaw()` maps `GooglePlaceRawDocument` → `RawExtractedMetadata` with structured location (lat/lng, address). Feeds existing `runNormalizationPipeline()` — same entity model as Instagram.

### Duplicate Detection

`placesDuplicateService` compares website, phone, coordinates, business name, city against `google_places_raw` and `normalized_records`. Confidence scoring — detect only, no merge.

### Configuration

`lib/config/google-places.ts` — `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`, default radius, result limit, language.

## Phase 11 — Website Discovery & Public Metadata Import

Collectors discover and import publicly available website metadata — titles, contact details, social links, and business information. No authentication bypass. Respects robots.txt when configured. Results flow into the existing review and normalization pipeline.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/websites` | Discovery hub overview |
| `/imports/websites` | URL paste, CSV upload, domain import, preview, job creation |
| `/websites/jobs` | Discovery job history |
| `/websites/results` | Extracted website results with bulk import actions |
| `/websites/[id]` | Website detail with contacts, social links, duplicate detection |

### Website Import Flow

```
Collector submits URLs (single, bulk, CSV, domain)
  → POST /api/websites/discover
  → websiteDiscoveryService.runWebsiteDiscoveryJob()
  → WebsiteExtractionProvider.extract() (Mock or Live fetch — no Playwright in UI)
  → website_jobs + website_raw
  → Results UI with bulk actions
  → POST /api/websites/import
  → websiteImportService → import_jobs + import_records (review workflow)
  → websiteNormalizationService → normalized_records (existing pipeline)
```

### Provider Interfaces

- `WebsiteDiscoveryProvider` — URL validation and discovery job orchestration (`lib/types/website-discovery.ts`)
- `WebsiteExtractionProvider` — public metadata extraction (`MockWebsiteExtractionProvider`, `LiveWebsiteExtractionProvider` in `websiteExtractionService.ts`)

UI and services depend on interfaces only — not Playwright. Future worker integration via existing queue runtime and provider registry.

### Metadata Extraction Pipeline

1. Parse and validate URLs (single, bulk, CSV, domain)
2. Extract public HTML metadata (title, meta description, lang)
3. Detect emails, phones, social links from visible page content
4. Infer business type from public text
5. Persist to `website_raw`
6. On import: normalize via `websiteToRaw()` → `runNormalizationPipeline()`

### Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `website_jobs` | Discovery execution jobs with URL counts and status |
| `website_raw` | Extracted public website metadata |

### Duplicate Detection

`websiteDuplicateService` compares website URL, domain, public email, phone, and business name against `website_raw` and `normalized_records`. Confidence scoring — detect only, no merge.

### Configuration

`lib/config/websites.ts` — `WEBSITE_WORKER_ENABLED`, `WEBSITE_EXTRACTION_MODE`, max URLs per job, robots.txt respect flag.

## Phase 12 — Duplicate Resolution & Merge Center

Professional duplicate resolution workflow for normalized entities. Human approval required — no automatic merge.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/duplicates` | Pending matches dashboard with summary cards and filterable table |
| `/duplicates/[matchId]` | Side-by-side comparison, merge preview, resolution actions |
| `/duplicates/resolved` | Previously resolved matches |
| `/duplicates/ignored` | Ignored / dismissed matches |

### Merge Flow

```
Normalization pipeline detects potential matches → entity_matches (status: pending)
  → Reviewer opens /duplicates/[matchId]
  → Side-by-side comparison (DuplicateComparePanel)
  → Optional field selection for merge (MergeFieldSelector)
  → Merge preview (MergePreviewCard)
  → POST /api/duplicates/[matchId]/resolve
  → mergeService.resolveMatch()
  → Update match status + create merge_history entry
  → Update normalized_records status (merged/duplicate/approved) — no deletes
```

### Resolution Actions

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Merge Records | Create/update canonical record from field selections; mark A merged, B duplicate |
| Mark Duplicate | Mark Record B as duplicate |
| Keep Separate | Resolve match — entities remain distinct |
| Ignore Match | Dismiss as false positive |
| Approve Both | Approve both records independently |
| Needs Review | Flag for additional review |

### Audit Trail

Every resolution action creates a `merge_history` record with performer, timestamp, notes, field selections, and result record ID. Original records are never deleted.

### Canonical Record Strategy

Merging creates or updates a canonical normalized record from reviewer-selected fields. Source records are preserved with updated status (`merged`, `duplicate`, or `approved`). Full audit trail in `merge_history`.

### Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `entity_matches` | Match pairs with status, reasons, confidence, resolution |
| `merge_history` | Audit log of all resolution actions |
| `normalized_records` | Entity records (status includes merged/duplicate) |

### Services

- `matchScoringService` — confidence levels, reason labels, field-to-reason mapping
- `duplicateResolutionService` — dashboard data, match listing, detail loading
- `mergeService` — merge preview, field selection, resolution execution

## Phase 13 — CSV Bulk Import

Collectors upload CSV files with automotive records. Records pass through mapping, validation, duplicate detection, normalization, and admin review.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/imports/csv` | CSV import hub |
| `/imports/csv/new` | Upload → map → validate → import wizard |
| `/imports/csv/[jobId]` | Job detail with record preview |
| `/imports/csv/history` | Import history |

See [CSV_IMPORT.md](./CSV_IMPORT.md) for full schema, validation rules, and lifecycle documentation.

### Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `csv_import_jobs` | CSV upload jobs with mapping and status |
| `csv_import_records` | Per-row validation and mapped data |

### Normalization Integration

`csvRowToRaw()` maps CSV rows → `RawExtractedMetadata` with `source: "csv"`. Feeds existing `runNormalizationPipeline()` — same entity model as other sources.

## Phase 14 — Unified Import Pipeline

Connects every import module into one automated end-to-end pipeline. All providers follow the same lifecycle.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/pipeline` | Pipeline dashboard with summary cards and job list |
| `/pipeline/[jobId]` | Visualizer, timeline, events, progress |

See [PIPELINE.md](./PIPELINE.md) for full schema, stages, and provider lifecycle.

### Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `pipeline_jobs` | Unified pipeline job tracking |
| `pipeline_events` | Append-only pipeline audit trail |
| `publish_queue` | Approved records awaiting public app consumption |

### Services

- `pipelineEngine` — provider abstraction and stage orchestration
- `pipelineService` — job CRUD, dashboard, stage advancement
- `publishQueueService` — enqueue on approval, publish status
- `pipelineIntegrationService` — hooks into existing import flows

## Phase 15 — Real Instagram Public Metadata Provider

Connects the worker runtime to a real public profile metadata extraction implementation.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/instagram/test` | Internal single-profile extraction test |

See [INSTAGRAM_PROVIDER.md](./INSTAGRAM_PROVIDER.md) for allowed data, rate limits, and configuration.

### Configuration

`ENABLE_INSTAGRAM_EXTRACTION=false` by default. Live extraction must be explicitly enabled.

## Phase 16 — Discovery Engine

Campaign-based automotive discovery that flows into the import pipeline.

### Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/discovery` | Discovery dashboard |
| `/discovery/new` | Campaign builder |
| `/discovery/campaigns` | Campaign list and detail |
| `/discovery/jobs` | Discovery job execution |
| `/discovery/history` | Completed jobs and results |
| `/discovery/templates` | Reusable templates |

See [DISCOVERY_ENGINE.md](./DISCOVERY_ENGINE.md) for campaigns, provider dispatch, and lifecycle.

### Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `discovery_campaigns` | Search campaign definitions |
| `discovery_jobs` | Campaign execution jobs |
| `discovery_templates` | Reusable campaign templates |
| `discovery_results` | Standardized discovery results |

## Mock Mode

When Firebase is not configured:

- In-memory store via `lib/mock-data/importJobStore.ts`, `reviewStore.ts`, `queueStore.ts`, and `normalizationStore.ts`
- Seeded demo data via `reviewSeedData.ts`, `queueSeedData.ts`, and `normalizationSeedData.ts` when empty
- UI displays **Mock Mode** badge and warning banner
- Application continues to function for development

## Out of Scope (Future Phases)

- Browser automation providers (Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium) — swap via `ProfileExtractionProvider` / `WebsiteExtractionProvider`
- TikTok / YouTube extractors (ExtractionProvider registry ready)
- AI classification (normalization services are AI-ready)
- Profile metadata extraction
- Chrome extension

## Roles

| Role      | Purpose                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Admin     | Full platform access, approve/reject/merge   |
| Collector | Data discovery and import submission (read-only in Review Center) |
| Reviewer  | Record review, approval, and duplicate resolution |

Role permissions are defined in `lib/types/review.ts` (`REVIEW_ROLE_PERMISSIONS`).
